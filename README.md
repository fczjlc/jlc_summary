写该文档缘由：互助，帮更多人避坑，以下都是真实的工作点评，发在社交平台会被要求删帖，但这里安全



缺点：
1.社保公积金按最低标准交
2.年假5天，全公司过年统一休，没有育儿假，也没有其他假期，来这里打工相当于一头牛马，全年无休，年会占用年假时间
3.老板江西人，特别抠门，有重要的项目也不愿意多发钱
4.升职加薪机会少，入职即巅峰，加班严重且没有工资，每月评绩效和升职评比会看加班时长
5.付出和回报不成正比，你的个人年终奖，主动或被动离职一分都不会给
6.这公司非常爱干卸磨杀驴的事情，经常搞PIP和不续签操作，需要你的时候得拼命加班，不需要你一脚就踢开你



优点：
1.每月18日准时发放薪资
2.有面包零食柜
3.没有太多糟心的事

总结：有好的选择，千万别来，来了你得把待遇谈好，这里没有躺平的机会，等你空闲点就是快要被干掉的时候了，这公司有互联网的病，没有互联网的待遇

Reason for writing this document: Mutual help, to help more people avoid pitfalls. The following are all real job reviews. Posting on social media platforms would require deletion, but it's safe here.

Disadvantages:
1. Social security and housing fund contributions are at the minimum standard.
2. 5 days of annual leave, the whole company takes a unified holiday during the Spring Festival, no parental leave, and no other holidays. Working here is like being a beast of burden, with no days off all year round. The annual meeting takes up annual leave time.
3. The boss is from Jiangxi and is extremely stingy. He is unwilling to pay more for important projects.
4. Few opportunities for promotion and salary increases. You reach your peak as soon as you join. Overtime is severe and unpaid. Monthly performance reviews and promotions will consider overtime hours.

5. The effort and reward are disproportionate; you won't receive your year-end bonus if you leave voluntarily or involuntarily.

6. This company is notorious for its exploitative practices, frequently implementing Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) and not renewing contracts. You'll be expected to work tirelessly when they need you, but they'll discard you as soon as they don't.

Advantages:
1. Salary is paid on time on the 18th of each month.
2. There's a bread and snack cabinet.
3. Not too many stressful things.

Summary: If you have a better option, don't come here. If you do, you need to negotiate the compensation. There's no room for complacency here; the moment you have some free time, you're about to be laid off. This company has the problems of the internet industry but not the benefits.
